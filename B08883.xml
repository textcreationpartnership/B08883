            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>e, near Tinmouth-Barre, ſince December, 1672.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>When Eight Ships were overwhelmed by the Freſhes, of which Six were (as not lying difficult) removed and cleared the firſt month; the other Two being great and deep laden, ſunk in the beſt of the Harbour, were blown up with Gun-powder a few months after, with ſome particulars of what Change happened that Harbour thereupon to this preſent</hi> Auguſt <hi>following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE two Wrecks called Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grayes</hi> Ships, ſunk where before was not above 10, 12, to 14 foot at low water; the one L lying on her broad ſide, the other K back-broken, ſate right up, faſt dockt, the Freſhes running with ſuch violence from Weſtward above, betwixt both Ships; and almoſt round about them ſuch a whirle Neddee of water, as may be compared to an Oriocano of wind, had the firſt Month ſcoured a Channel on the Weſt ſide of, and neer both theſe Wrecks, deep as they are marked 28, 30, to 33 foot alſo at low water, which Channel would have run lower, and ſo ſettled the Ships out of harms way, had they not at that depth met with a hard Cole-Mine; whereas at the Eaſt-ſide towards the Barre the old depth of 10, 12, to 14 foot at low water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued notwithſtanding the greateſt Storms, Surfs and Spring-Tides that happened out the Sea over the Barre, ſo neer the Wrecks for two months together after the Wrecks were ſo ſettled.</p>
            <p>For it was the Freſhes that overwhelmed theſe eight Ships in <hi>December,</hi> 1672. which no Storms ever did, whereof theſe two L, K ſunk in the beſt of the Harbour, as appears by the two Light-houſes C, D and the Barre M, for no Ships could ſteer into the Harbour by the lights, but muſt run hazard of being ſpoild, if not quite ſplit upon the Wrecks, they being beſet in ſuch a manner as the Wreck L, defended K, from the Sea, Eaſt, and K the like for L, from the Freſhes Weſt, that they were abſolutely fixt for Ages to continue, and that Harbour like to be loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Powder-blaſts upon theſe two Wrecks L, K, a few alterations hath appeared near the Barre to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wrecks lying ſo near the Hurd Sands N, cauſed ſuch a ſtrong Sluce betwixt that and the Wrecks, that it hath thrown the Hurd up further Southward, and conſequently the River and the Barre broader than it was before at that place, which is the cauſe of this in publick. Some ſmall alterations alſo it hath cauſed on ſundry Sands up the River, of which every Wherry-man can inform, although by what courſe it hath taken ſince the blaſts: All thoſe places are like in a year or two's time, to return to its old ſtation; for after the Ship L that had Lead in, was blown away, where at firſt it ſunk was but 10, 12, to 14 foot, after thirty dayes were 28, 30, to 33 foot, and after the blaſt one third part of four hundred peeces Lead being taken up at about 28 foot deep, within twenty daies after it ſhallowed to 17 and 20 foot, and daily more, till all the reſt of the Lead became buried.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Wrecks, one very near, and the other above 400 Ton full, laden with Coals, &amp;c. weighed about eight hundred thouſand pound weight apiece, beſides the empty Ships, which by the Ship-Carpenters Rule of proportion ought with all her Maſts, Anchors, Tackle, Rigging, &amp;c. to weigh near as much as her Lading in weighty Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if ſhe be deſigned long liv'd; to theſe add ſo many hundred Ton of Water or Sea atop of them. The difficulty of conveying a Powder-cheſt to execute under Water at them on the out-ſide of the Ships, many, <hi>viz.</hi> their lying ſo near the Barre, that what by one conſtant courſe or other happening every year, in three quarters thereof it could not be performed; for three dayes before, and three dayes after every Spring-tyde, reckoning the day of the Moons change, there's half of the year gone, how often the Wind is Eaſt, North, or N, E in a year, either of thoſe, with a reaſonable gale, makes too great a ſwell thereabouts to ſpend Powder-cheſts below; how many ſtormy dayes are there uſually in a year? when, and two dayes after every ſtorm, no dealing thereabouts in that buſineſs; and worſe than all this, rainy-weather ſometimes three or four dayes, after one dayes ſhowres, the Freſhes will bring down ſo ſwift a Current, that over againſt <hi>Cliffords</hi> Fort, and the Figure 30, makes for a matter of a hundred and fifty fathom length, a gulf, ſwifter than that of <hi>Florida.</hi> To all theſe, one difficulty more as bad as the worſt, the Neddee, or Whirle of Water, would without great pains and care overturn the Engine from its deſigned place, which ſundry particular difficulties I mention, becauſe ſome unskilful pretenders to this part of the Mathematicks, expected that ſo great a weight and bulk before-mentioned, beſides Lead and Stones, in one of them, ſhould with one Cheſt containing ſeven barrels of Powder, be blown up from that depth, ſo eaſie and ſo high above Water, as the Boyes ſend up Kites, which could not have been hoped from ſeven thouſand barrels, the Ships not being to be undermined, and the Powder-cheſts being fired at the ſides of the Ships; but, were ſuch a buſineſs to be done in the Waters of <hi>Thames,</hi> as many Cheſts might be ſpent, and Ships blown up in twenty dayes, as could be done at this Barre in a year at ſuch weather as was there ſix months together; and every day one could be done to an empty Ship in ſuch ſtreams as the <hi>Thames,</hi> and where the Cheſt could be conveyed in the hold.</p>
            <p>At any of which Weathers, or at the neareſt of a Slack (if any ever be there) all former known waies would have failed, as divers (to any other purpoſe but vain expences) were endeavoured before my coming there; for no flying Fuſee would burn to the bottom, but either bend or break, which muſt needs choak or drown the Wild-fire by the way; ſo that poſſibility it ſelf became to be queſtioned, whether ever the Harbour were like to be cleared, or at the beſt to the coſt of many thouſands; thereupon the Magiſtrates ſent up a Relation of the dangerous condition His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Port of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> was in; His Majeſtie was pleaſed to ſend unto them a new way to convey a Fire-Ball through a hollow Maſt faſtned to the Cheſt at the bottom of the Sea, the Cheſt ſhaped and ordered within and without in ſuch a figure, as the deſigned place could be executed upon, as true under Water, as Guns can ſend out Bullets above, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto was never known, or at leaſt not known to be practiſed in any Country by any Nation whatſoever before; by virtue whereof the Author can deſtroy and remove all ſuch Sinckers, as was this and the laſt year, or at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may be deſigned by the enemy, as certain (without undermining) as Rocks (which cannot be done but with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining) can be blown up above ground, whether the Sinckers are fill'd with Sand, Coals, Stones, Bricks, Morter, in a maſs, or looſe, the like of any other matter of weight whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And in regard the appearance of Smoak above Water after the blaſt ſo far under, hath ſtartled the inquiſitive Chimiſt in point of nature, that the Sea-water being ſalt, and Gun-powder likewiſe ſalt, its Smoak alſo ſalt, muſt therefore certainly incorporate together, and none of that Smoak ever be ſeen above-water.</p>
            <p>I have purpoſely placed this figure V to ſhew how the Water and Smoak, with pieces of the Ship did appear for a moment or two above water, a matter of a quarter of a minute after the Powder took fire below, without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to that rule of nature; for theſe ſix or ſeven barrels of Powder ſpent together under Water, produced no more Smoak or report above, than is uſual from one Ordnance (although thoſe that ſtood a mile off upon the Hills, felt the ground ſhake under them at the blow) and doubtleſs therefore by that natural rule, the Smoak muſt all have diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Salt-water, had the blaſt been deeper, or the quantity of Powder leſs, which being ſo much, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſwift through ſuch a ſhallow as twenty eight foot, ſome Smoak appeared above, by the ſame rule, as a Gnatt paſſing through a ſmall flame, muſt diſſolve in the flame; but by reaſon of its ſwift paſſage, part of him appears ſcorcht on th'other ſide. And for another Gentlemans opinion, to confirm the foregoing, that this lower Smoak W having not ſo ſwift a way as the uppermoſt X before it: where the report began was therefore the ſadder colour, as if it had been dyed in the paſſage, is not ſo probable, but palpable to the contrary in my opinion; rather that the ſadneſs of the Smoak about the Water W paſſing through the Ship, and up with the Coals, became blackiſh by the Coals; and nothing more certain, but that almoſt all the Smoak was mingled with the Sea; elſe had but half of it broke out above at X, it muſt conſequently have ſhaken both South and North Sheilds.</p>
